## Error Log Analysis Tool

This Python script processes error log data in CSV format and performs trend analysis on various aspects of the logs. The tool reads error logs, calculates the frequency of different error codes, identifies severity trends, computes average resolution time, and identifies the most frequent users generating errors.

# Features:

Error Code Trend Analysis: Identifies and lists the top 5 most frequent error codes in the logs.
Severity Breakdown: Analyzes and displays the distribution of errors by severity.
Average Resolution Time: Computes the average time taken to resolve errors (if available).
User Error Count: Tracks the top 5 users who generate the most errors.
Handles missing or invalid data: Warns about missing fields or invalid data and continues processing.

# Requirements:

This script requires Python 3.7+ and the following Python libraries:

pandas: For handling CSV files and data processing.
collections: For counting occurrences efficiently.
datetime: For handling and manipulating timestamp data (if required).

# How to Use
Step 1: Prepare Your Log Data
Ensure your error log data is in CSV format and contains the following columns:
error_code: The code associated with the error.
error_message: The message describing the error.
timestamp: The time the error occurred.
source: The source of the error (e.g., module, service).
severity: The severity level of the error (e.g., low, medium, high).
user_id: The user associated with the error.
device_type: The type of device (e.g., mobile, desktop).
location: The location of the error (e.g., region, city).
resolution_time: The time taken to resolve the error (in minutes).
resolved_by: The person or system who resolved the error.

Step 2: Update the File Path
Make sure that the filename variable in the error_logs.py script points to the correct path of your CSV file. Update the path in the script to match the location of your file:
filename = '/path/to/your/error_log_data.csv'

Step 3: Run the Script
Once the file path is correctly set, run the script using Python:
python error_logs.py

Step 4: View the Analysis Results
The script will process the log file and display the following trend analysis:
Top 5 most frequent error codes.
Breakdown of errors by severity.
Average resolution time (if data is available).
Top 5 users with the most errors.

Example Output:

Top 5 Error Codes:
E001: 150 occurrences
E003: 120 occurrences
E002: 80 occurrences
E004: 50 occurrences
E005: 30 occurrences

Severity Breakdown:
High: 200 occurrences
Medium: 150 occurrences
Low: 100 occurrences

Average Resolution Time: 45.32 minutes

Top 5 Users with Most Errors:
User 123: 50 errors
User 456: 30 errors
User 789: 20 errors
User 101: 10 errors
User 202: 8 errors
